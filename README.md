# Factors in Finetuning Deep Model for object detection

by Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang, Cong Zhang, Xiaokang Yang

### Introduction

We cluster objects into visually similar class groups and learn deep representations for these groups separately. A hierarchical feature learning scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the knowledge from the group with large number of classes is transferred for learning features in its sub-groups. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05150).
